Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating systems that can learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. By using algorithms and statistical models, these systems analyze patterns in data, improve their performance over time, and adapt to new information. Applications range from recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles to healthcare diagnostics and financial forecasting, making it a transformative technology in today's digital age.
